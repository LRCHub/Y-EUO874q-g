[00:22.96] They'll conquer us if we divide
[00:26.33] And no one will listen to you
[00:29.26] We gotta stand up and draw a line
[00:32.74] It's time to fall back or shoot
[00:48.24] 
[00:36.31] Why does it feel like they don't feel anything?
[00:42.76] I pray there's a future behind those walls
[00:47.88] But maybe I'm delusional
[00:49.61] Let's make a deal
[00:52.18] Pretend this bastard democracy is just how we want it
[00:57.65] And we're not exhausted
[01:00.92] But maybe we're delusional
[01:07.53] We're all de-fucking-lusional
[01:22.03] 
[01:16.21] When everything's supposed to happen for a reason
[01:19.68] And every talking head expects ya to believe them
[01:23.09] But we don't need them, we are the kingdom
[01:26.29] We know the amount that we have shared was never even
[01:52.79] 
[01:29.10] Why does it feel like they don't feel anything?
[01:35.62] I pray there's a future behind those walls
[01:40.73] But maybe I'm delusional
[01:42.58] Let's make a deal
[01:44.95] Pretend this bastard democracy is just how we want it
[01:50.64] And we're not exhausted
[02:02.14] 
[01:55.71] I know
[01:57.40] In order to be free you gotta let go
[02:00.52] But know that once you do
[02:01.98] That's when they take hold
[02:04.05] Everything's fair in love and war, so
[02:22.55] 
[02:09.02] Why does it feel like they don't feel anything?
[02:15.41] I pray there's a future behind those walls
[02:20.43] But maybe I'm delusional
[02:22.40] Let's make a deal
[02:24.68] Pretend this bastard democracy is just how we want it
[02:30.25] And we're not exhausted
[02:33.64] But maybe I'm delusional
[02:45.64] 
[02:36.91] But maybe I'm delusional
[02:40.36] But maybe I'm delusional (we are delusional)
[02:47.01] We're all de-fucking-lusional
